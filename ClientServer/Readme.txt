This server is the Client server where users can log in to play scrabble with each other. Currently it only supports 1 v 1 matches.
Majority of the scrabble game back-work was written by Samuel Uong and Edwin Zhou with help from Jaydev Patel.
I would just like to note that this project was much more complicated than the other 490 projects that were posted as it required much more coding than creating a webpage with API calls and some SQL read/write statements: meaning that there is a lot more code to go wrong
Currently this server has its own SQL instance for matchmaking (This is more of a client side process than authentication as it does not store any sensitive information).
In order to implement rabbitmq into matchmaking, you would just need to replace all calls to the file executeFunction.php in javascript with executeFunctionRabbit.php along with changing some simple php snippets on scrabbleGame.php, findMatch.php, and waitingForTurn.php.
The changes would include removing the connecting to the local SQL database and changing local calls to the SQL Functions to calling the rabbitmq calls inside executeFunctionRabbit.php's if statement (This is doable, but not as efficient as keeping local temporary things such as match making local, while keeping user credentials and match history in the "cloud" of a specified sql server).
