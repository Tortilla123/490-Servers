This server contains the API call.
It was originally written by Timmothy Koppisch and edited by Samuel Uong and Edwin Zhou.

In order to get the API call to work, internet access is required and the DMZServer.php needs to be run (php DMZServer.php)
php-curl also needs to be installed in order for our php function to call the API.

The file "oldwordcheckwithcomments.php" is Tim's original code,
wordcheck.php was basically created by me and Edwin Zhou based off of Tim's code.
